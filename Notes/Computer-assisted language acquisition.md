# Computer-assisted language acquisition

Computer-assisted language acquisition is not an opposite of [[Traditional language acquisition]], but instead can be treated as an extension of it. Many traditional methods have adopted technology in some way to ease many of the limitations that arise from traditional methods. 

Textbooks many times will offer a digital complement to the book in some way, taking the form of digital audio, quizzes, and reference material. This eases textbook use for learners who don't have access to a classroom environment.
