# Traditional Language Acquisition

When I refer to traditional language acquisition, I mean language acquisition without the aid of technology, or more precisely, where interfacing with digital technology is not a major component of the method. Examples include textbooks, in-country immersion, classrooms. The way you probably might have been taught a language in school.

Some of these methods tie more nicely into Krashen's [[Second language acquisition]] model than others. Textbooks are more akin to conscious language learning, while in-country immersion is more like subconscious language acquisition. 

Many traditional language acquisition methods have steep limitations. While traveling to a country and living there might theoretically be one of the best ways to acquire their language, it's simply not viable for everyone. It's expensive, it's risky, and it's just not an appealing method for many. Textbooks and classrooms also have their own unique limitations. They both also cost money, typically have issues with teaching a textbook-model of a language rather than focusing on exposure to the language as natives know it, and since most textbooks are written with a classroom environment in mind, it makes the experience much more limiting without one.

[[Computer-assisted language acquisition]] provides solutions to many of these problems.
