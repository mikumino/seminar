# Second Language Acquisition

There is a distinct difference that can be drawn between 'language acquisition' and 'language learning.' While the two terms are often used interchangeably, Dr. [[Stephen Krashen]], Emeritus Professor of Education at the University of Southern California, refers to the difference between the two mechanisms as **subconscious** and **conscious** respectively. [^1] 

He describes the former, language acquisition, as "very similar to the process children use in acquiring first and second languages. [^1]"  What makes the process similar to what children use is the way in which the speaker interacts with the language. Krashen describes it as meaningful and natural communication where **conveying and understanding messages** is prioritized over the construction of communication through explicit rules [^1]. 

Language learning, however, is described to be a conscious process, defined by rules and heavy correction. Krashen argues in his paper "Second Language Acquisition and Second Language Learning" [^1] that subconscious acquisition is more important than conscious learning.
